				 A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full <b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,</b> was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.
				He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the
				Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969, he moved to the Indian
			    Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was
				both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which
				helped earn him the nickname <strong> “Missile Man.”</strong><br><br>Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
				ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical,
				and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
				From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal
				scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the government with the rank of cabinet minister. His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
				solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero, although the tests caused great concern
				in the international community.
				In 1998 Kalam put forward a countrywide plan called Technology Vision 2020, which he describe as a road map for transforming India from
				a less-developed to a developed society in 20 years. The plan called for, among other measures, increasing agricultural
				productivity, emphasizing technology as a vehicle for economic growth, and widening access to health care and education.
				Kalam received <b>7</b> honorary doctorates from <b>40</b>universities. The Government of India honoured him with the <b>Padma Bhushan
				in 1981</b> and the <b>Padma Vibhushan in 1990</b> for his work with ISRO and DRDO and his role as a scientific advisor
				to the Government. In 1997, Kalam received India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna, for his contribution to
	            the scientific research and modernisation of defence technology in India. In 2013, he was the recipient of the Von Braun Award from
				the National Space Society "to recognize excellence in the management and leadership of a space-related project".
				While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on
				<b>27 July 2015</b>, aged 83.Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September
				2015.A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b> in August 2015.
				In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant
				species as Drypetes kalamii, in his
				honour.<br><br>

				<b>Presidency</b><br>
				Kalam served as the 11th president of India, succeeding K. R. Narayanan. He won the 2002 presidential election with an
				electoral vote of 922,884, surpassing the 107,366 votes won by Lakshmi Sahgal. His term lasted from <b>25 July 2002, to 25 
				July 2007.</b>
				On 10 June 2002, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) which was in power at the time, expressed that they would nominate Kalam for the
 				post of President, and both the Samajwadi Party and the Nationalist Congress Party backed his candidacy. After the 
 				Samajwadi Party announced its support for Kalam, Narayanan chose not to seek a second term in office, leaving the field clear.[43] Kalam
				said of the announcement of his candidature:
				I am really overwhelmed. Everywhere both in Internet and in other media, I have been asked for a message. I was thinking what message I can 
				give to the people of the country at this juncture.
				On 18 June, Kalam filed his nomination papers in the Indian Parliament, accompanied by Vajpayee and his senior Cabinet colleagues.[45]
				Kalam along with Vladimir Putin and Manmohan Singh during his presidency
				The polling for the presidential election began on 15 July 2002, in Parliament and the state assemblies, with the media claiming that the 
				election was a one-sided affair and Kalam's victory was a foregone conclusion; the count was held on 18 July. <b>Kalam became the 11th 
				president of the Republic of India in an easy victory,</b> and moved into the Rashtrapati Bhavan after he was sworn in on 25 July.[48] Kalam
 				was the third President of India to have been honoured with a Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, before becoming the President
  				Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan (1954) and Zakir Hussain (1963) were the earlier recipients of Bharat Ratna who later became the President of
   				India.He was also the first scientist and the first bachelor to occupy Rashtrapati Bhawan.<br><br>
